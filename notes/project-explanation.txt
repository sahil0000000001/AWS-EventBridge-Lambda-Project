This project uses Amazon EventBridge to trigger an AWS Lambda function automatically.
EventBridge listens for defined events and invokes Lambda without manual intervention.
Lambda executes Python code and logs output to CloudWatch.
This approach follows serverless and event-driven architecture principles.
